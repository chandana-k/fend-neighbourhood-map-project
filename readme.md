This is the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Neighbourhood Map Project which showcases the best parks around the Research Triangle Park area in North Carolina.

- To run the demo, open the 'index.html' in a browser.
- The project page is responsive and you can test the different states with the dev tools (Chrome).
- The page rendered shows a full blown google map with the markers of the chosen Parks. 
- Hovering on the Marker opens up a popup showing the Park Name and the Foursquare photos of the park.

The project uses Knockout JS for a simple MVVM Architecture.
